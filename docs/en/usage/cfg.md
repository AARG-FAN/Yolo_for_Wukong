  <strong>Watch:</strong> Mastering Ultralytics YOLOv8: Configuration
</p>

Ultralytics commands use the following syntax:

!!! Example

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        yolo TASK MODE ARGS
        ```

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a YOLOv8 model from a pre-trained weights file
        model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")

        # Run MODE mode using the custom arguments ARGS (guess TASK)
        model.MODE(ARGS)
        ```

Where:

- `TASK` (optional) is one of ([detect](../tasks/detect.md), [segment](../tasks/segment.md), [classify](../tasks/classify.md), [pose](../tasks/pose.md))
- `MODE` (required) is one of ([train](../modes/train.md), [val](../modes/val.md), [predict](../modes/predict.md), [export](../modes/export.md), [track](../modes/track.md))
- `ARGS` (optional) are `arg=value` pairs like `imgsz=640` that override defaults.

Default `ARG` values are defined on this page from the `cfg/defaults.yaml` [file](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/default.yaml).

!!! info "Note on Batch-size Settings"

    The `batch` argument can be configured in three ways:

    - **Fixed Batch Size**: Set an integer value (e.g., `batch=16`), specifying the number of images per batch directly.
    - **Auto Mode (60% GPU Memory)**: Use `batch=-1` to automatically adjust batch size for approximately 60% CUDA memory utilization.
    - **Auto Mode with Utilization Fraction**: Set a fraction value (e.g., `batch=0.70`) to adjust batch size based on the specified fraction of GPU memory usage.

The prediction settings for YOLO models encompass a range of hyperparameters and configurations that influence the model's performance, speed, and accuracy during inference on new data. Careful tuning and experimentation with these settings are essential to achieve optimal performance for a specific task. Key settings include the confidence threshold, Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) threshold, and the number of classes considered. Additional factors affecting the prediction process are input data size and format, the presence of supplementary features such as masks or multiple labels per box, and the particular task the model is employed for.

## Logging, Checkpoints and Plotting Settings

Logging, checkpoints, plotting, and file management are important considerations when training a YOLO model.

- Logging: It is often helpful to log various metrics and statistics during training to track the model's progress and diagnose any issues that may arise. This can be done using a logging library such as TensorBoard or by writing log messages to a file.
- Checkpoints: It is a good practice to save checkpoints of the model at regular intervals during training. This allows you to resume training from a previous point if the training process is interrupted or if you want to experiment with different training configurations.
- Plotting: Visualizing the model's performance and training progress can be helpful for understanding how the model is behaving and identifying potential issues. This can be done using a plotting library such as matplotlib or by generating plots using a logging library such as TensorBoard.
- File management: Managing the various files generated during the training process, such as model checkpoints, log files, and plots, can be challenging. It is important to have a clear and organized file structure to keep track of these files and make it easy to access and analyze them as needed.

Effective logging, checkpointing, plotting, and file management can help you keep track of the model's progress and make it easier to debug and optimize the training process.

| `name`     | `'exp'`  | Defines the name of the experiment. If not specified, YOLO automatically increments this name for each run, e.g., `exp`, `exp2`, etc., to avoid overwriting previous experiments.                                                  |
| `exist_ok` | `False`  | Determines whether to overwrite an existing experiment directory if one with the same name already exists. Setting this to `True` allows overwriting, while `False` prevents it.                                                   |
| `plots`    | `False`  | Controls the generation and saving of training and validation plots. Set to `True` to create plots such as loss curves, precision-recall curves, and sample predictions. Useful for visually tracking model performance over time. |
| `save`     | `False`  | Enables the saving of training checkpoints and final model weights. Set to `True` to periodically save model states, allowing training to be resumed from these checkpoints or models to be deployed.                              |

## FAQ

### How do I improve the performance of my YOLO model during training?

Improving YOLO model performance involves tuning hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, momentum, and weight decay. Adjusting augmentation settings, selecting the right optimizer, and employing techniques like early stopping or mixed precision can also help. For detailed guidance on training settings, refer to the [Train Guide](../modes/train.md).

### What are the key hyperparameters to consider for YOLO model accuracy?

Key hyperparameters affecting YOLO model accuracy include:

- **Batch Size (`batch`)**: Larger batch sizes can stabilize training but may require more memory.
- **Learning Rate (`lr0`)**: Controls the step size for weight updates; smaller rates offer fine adjustments but slow convergence.
- **Momentum (`momentum`)**: Helps accelerate gradient vectors in the right directions, dampening oscillations.
- **Image Size (`imgsz`)**: Larger image sizes can improve accuracy but increase computational load.

Adjust these values based on your dataset and hardware capabilities. Explore more in the [Train Settings](#train-settings) section.

### How do I set the learning rate for training a YOLO model?

The learning rate (`lr0`) is crucial for optimization. A common starting point is `0.01` for SGD or `0.001` for Adam. It's essential to monitor training metrics and adjust if necessary. Use cosine learning rate schedulers (`cos_lr`) or warmup techniques (`warmup_epochs`, `warmup_momentum`) to dynamically modify the rate during training. Find more details in the [Train Guide](../modes/train.md).

### What are the default inference settings for YOLO models?

Default inference settings include:

- **Confidence Threshold (`conf=0.25`)**: Minimum confidence for detections.
- **IoU Threshold (`iou=0.7`)**: For Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS).
- **Image Size (`imgsz=640`)**: Resizes input images prior to inference.
- **Device (`device=None`)**: Selects CPU or GPU for inference.
    For a comprehensive overview, visit the [Predict Settings](#predict-settings) section and the [Predict Guide](../modes/predict.md).

### Why should I use mixed precision training with YOLO models?

Mixed precision training, enabled with `amp=True`, helps reduce memory usage and can speed up training by utilizing the advantages of both FP16 and FP32. This is beneficial for modern GPUs, which support mixed precision natively, allowing more models to fit in memory and enable faster computations without significant loss in accuracy. Learn more about this in the [Train Guide](../modes/train.md).
