# Ultralytics HUB Integrations

Learn about [Ultralytics HUB](https://ultralytics.com/hub) integrations with various platforms and formats.

## Datasets

Seamlessly import your datasets in [Ultralytics HUB](https://ultralytics.com/hub) for [model training](./models.md#train-model).

After a dataset is imported in [Ultralytics HUB](https://ultralytics.com/hub), you can [train a model](./models.md#train-model) on your dataset just like you would using the [Ultralytics HUB](https://ultralytics.com/hub) datasets.

### Roboflow

You can easily filter the [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) datasets on the [Ultralytics HUB](https://ultralytics.com/hub) [Datasets](https://hub.ultralytics.com/datasets) page.

[Ultralytics HUB](https://ultralytics.com/hub) supports two types of integrations with [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics), [Universe](#universe) and [Workspace](#workspace).

#### Universe

The [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) Universe integration allows you to import one dataset at a time into [Ultralytics HUB](https://ultralytics.com/hub) from [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics).

##### Import

When you export a [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) dataset, select the [Ultralytics HUB](https://ultralytics.com/hub) format. This action will redirect you to [Ultralytics HUB](https://ultralytics.com/hub) and trigger the **Dataset Import** dialog.

You can import your [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) dataset by clicking on the **Import** button.

##### Remove

Navigate to the Dataset page of the [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) dataset you want to remove, open the dataset actions dropdown and click on the **Remove** option.

![Ultralytics HUB screenshot of the Dataset page of a Roboflow Universe dataset with an arrow pointing to the Remove option](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/assets/main/docs/hub/integrations/hub_roboflow_universe_remove_1.jpg)

??? tip "Tip"

    You can remove an imported [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) dataset directly from the [Datasets](https://hub.ultralytics.com/datasets) page.
